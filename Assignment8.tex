We need to show that if $f$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}^+$ and $f(x^2) = f(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^+$ then $f$ is constant.\\
\indent We break the domain of the problem up into $D_1 = [0,1)$ and $D_2 = [1,\infty)$. We also need two theorems from Rudin which are:


\begin{equation}
\lim_{n \to \infty} p^n = 0 \quad \text{if} \; p < 1 \label{eqn:limtozero}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{p} = 1 \quad \text{if} \; p > 0 \label{eqn:limtoone}
\end{equation}


For any $x \in D_1$ we may form a sequence $(x^n)$, and by equation $(\ref{eqn:limtozero})$, we know that $\lim_{n \to \infty} x^n = 0$. Then, by the continuity of $f$ we have $\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x^n) = f(0)$. Now, by hypothesis we have that \\
$f(x^2) = f(x)$, but $f(x^4) = f(x^2)$ so $f(x^4) = f(x)$. If we continue in this way we get a sequence $(f(x^{2n}))$ such that $f(x^{2n}) = f(x)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. By the previous comments we get $f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x^{2n}) = f(0)$.\\
\indent Now suppose that $x \in D_2$. Since $1 \le x \implies x \le x^2 \implies \sqrt{x} \le x$ we reconsider the relation $f(x^2) = f(x)$. Let $y \in D_2$ then let $y = x^2$ then we have $f(y) = f(\sqrt{y})$ for any $y \in D_2$. By reapplying the relation to a $y \in D_2$ we get a sequence $(f(\sqrt[2n]{y}))$ and by $(\ref{eqn:limtoone})$ we can again use continuity to say that $f(y) = \lim_{n \to \infty}f(\sqrt[2n]{y}) = f(1)$. \\
\indent We have shown that $f(x)= f(0)$ if $x \in D_1$ and $f(x)= f(1)$ if $x \in D_2$. By the continuity of $f$ we know that we must have $\lim_{x \to 1}f(x) = f(1)$. If $f(0) \neq f(1)$ then since the left hand limit is $\lim_{x \to 1}f(x) = f(0)$ and the right hand limit is $\lim_{x \to 1}f(x) = f(1)$ the function is discontinuous contrary to hypothesis. So we have shown that $f(x) = f(1)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^+$.

Given that $f$ is defined for $x > 0$ and differentiable and $f'(x) \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$ show that \\
$g(x) = f(x+1) - f(x)$ has the property that $g(x) \to 0$.  \\
\indent The proof is based on the mean value theorem which states that there exists an $x' \in (a,b)$ such that $f(b)-f(a) = f'(x')(b-a)$. If we let $a = x$ and $b = x+1$ then we get 
\[ g(x) = f(x+1) - f(x) = f'(x')(x+1 - x) = f'(x') \]
Since $x' \in (x,x+1)$ for all $x$ we have $x < x'$ so 
\[ \lim_{x \to \infty} g(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} f'(x')  =   \lim_{x' \to \infty} f'(x') = 0\]

We are being asked to show that the following equation has at least one root between 0 and 1:
\[ C_0 + C_1 x + \cdots + C_{n-1} x^{n-1} + C_n x^n = 0 \] 
 given that 
 \begin{equation} 
 C_0 + \frac{C_1}{2} + \cdots +\frac{C_{n-1}}{n} + \frac{C_n}{n+1}  = 0 \label{eqn:dercond}
 \end{equation}
 
 \noindent Given the form of $(\ref{eqn:dercond})$ we will use an auxiliary function to solve the problem. Consider the function:
 
 \begin{equation} 
 g(x) = C_0 x + C_1 \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots + C_{n-1} \frac{x^n}{n} + C_n \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} \label{eqn:auxfunc}
 \end{equation}
 
\noindent It is clear from the definition of $(\ref{eqn:auxfunc})$ that $g(0) = 0$ and also obviously the case that $g(1) = 0$ by $(\ref{eqn:dercond})$. From the mean value theorem we know that there exists $x \in (a,b)$ such that $f(b) - f(a) = f'(x)(b-a)$. Letting $a = 0$ and $b = 1$ we get that there is a $x \in (0,1)$ such that $0 = g(1)-g(0)  = g'(x)(1 - 0) = g'(x)$. We know however that 
\[ g'(x) =  C_0 + C_1 x + \cdots + C_{n-1} x^{n-1} + C_n x^n \]
so x is the desired root.

\noindent Part a) We need to show that there is at most one fixed point given that $f'(t) \neq 1$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$\\
\indent  Suppose there is more than one fixed point and let $x_0$ and $x_1$ be these fixed points.  By the mean value theorem there exists an $x \in (x_0,x_1)$ such that 
\begin{equation}
 f(x_1) - f(x_0) = f'(x)(x_1-x_0) \label{eqn:fixderiv}
 \end{equation}
However, since we have $f(x_0) = x_0$ and $f(x_1) = x_1$ equation $(\ref{eqn:fixderiv})$ gives
\[ f'(x) = \frac{f(x_1)-f(x_0)}{x_1-x_0} = \frac{x_1-x_0}{x_1-x_0} = 1\]
This is a contradiction, so there may be at most one fixed point.\\

\noindent Part b) We would like to show that $f(t) = t + (1+e^t)^{-1}$ has no fixed point eventhough $0 < f(t) < 1$ for all $t$.

If we have a fixed point then $f(t) = t$ by definition. So we have
\begin{equation}
t = t + (1+e^t)^{-1} \implies 0 = (1+e^t)^{-1} 
\end{equation}

Since $e^t > 0$ for all $t$ we must have $1+e^t > 0$ for all $t$. This says if there exists a $t$ satisfying the equation about we may multiply the above by $1+e^t$ to get $0 = 1$ which is a contradiction.\\

Part c) For the final part we must show that a fixed point of $f$ exists if $|f'(t)| \le A < 1$ for all $t$. We must all show that the sequence defined by $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$ with arbitrary $x_1$ converges to the fixed point.\\

For the first half we start by defining a function $g(t) = t - f(t)$. If $g(t_0) = 0$ then we are done so let's assume that at some $t_1$ we have $g(t_1) < 0 $. By hypothesis we have $f'(t) < A$ for all $t$ so let $\epsilon = 1 - A > 0$. From these observations we derive the following:
\begin{equation}
g'(t) = 1 - f'(t) > 1 - A = \epsilon > 0 \hspace{15pt} \text{for all t}\nonumber
\end{equation}
